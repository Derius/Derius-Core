Derius
======

An open skills framework for developers, that adds the core functionalities for your skills or abilities.

It is designed to be a fast and flexible alternative to the already existing skill plugins out there and shows its strengths in customizability and extendability.
With Derius, you can not only add simple leveling skills (like swordfighting), but also more abstract skills like magical schools or even cooking!
